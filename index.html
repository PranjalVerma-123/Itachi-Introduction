                      <h3>WHO IS HE ?</h3>
                      <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</p>

                                        <h4><span>Amaterasu</span></h4>
                                        <b>Type</b> - Kekkei Genkai<br>
                                        <b>Range </b> - All ranges (0-10m+)<br>
                                        <p>Amaterasu is an Eye Technique of the Mangekyo Sharingan. It is one of the most powerful ninjutsu in existence, opposite of Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu of similar power. Itachi Uchiha was the first person shown in Naruto that could use Amaterasu. He later gave the power to Sasuke Uchiha. The jet-black flames are said to be as hot as the sun. Since the Mangekyo Sharingan is necessary to be able to use this technique, not many have learned it. All that is known is that it is extremely powerful since it can punch through Jiraiya's Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind, which Jiraiya states to be fire retardent.</p>

                                      <b>Range </b> - Short range (0-5m)<br>
                                      <p>Tsukuyomi is one of the most powerful Genjutsu in existence. It is unique to the Uchiha clan and only those with the Mangekyo Sharingan can perform it. When executed, the jutsu traps the target in an illusionary world that is completely controlled by the user. While it only takes a few seconds to complete in the real world, the user can make it seem as if days have passed for the target. Depending on the user's whim, they can either torture their target for days on end, or make them relive a traumatic event over and over. When the jutsu ends the resultant psychological trauma will render the target unable to fight for a while, and possibly suffer a complete mental breakdown.</p>

                                      <p>Susanoo is a technique that creates a spiritual being resembling a yamabushi wielding the sacred Yata no Kagami (???, Eight Span Mirror), a mirror that's considered one of the three sacred treasures capable of reflecting all attacks, as a shield in its left hand, and in its right, the legendary Totsuka no Tsurugi (???, Ten Hands Long Sword), also known as the Sakenagi Longsword (????, Sakenagi no Tachi; Sake Cutter Longsword). The Totsuka no Tsurugi, commonly sheathed in a sake jar held by a third hand growing from Susanoo's right forearm, is an ethereal weapon with an enchanted blade capable of sealing anything it pierces in an eternal dream-like illusion, and is described as the perfect counter to Orochimaru's Kusanagi Sword.[1] Like the Amaterasu, and Tsukuyomi, Susanoo is an ability of the Mangekyo Sharingan. Zetsu said that Susanoo's Totsuka Sword combined with the Yata mirror essentially makes Itachi invincible.</p>

                          <h3>Childhood</h3>
                          <p>Itachi was a member of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha.He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan, establishing milestones for Sasuke and future Uchiha to live up to. His early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost.Learning that his clan began planning a coup d'état to take control of Konoha after being unjustly accused of attacking the village with the Nine Tails, Itachi feared a war would break and became a double agent to provide Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions. Thus over time, Itachi began to distance himself from his clan as some believed he murdered his best friend Shisui Uchiha to gain a Mangekyo Sharingan. But  in reality, as he possesses an ability to subliminally manipulate others, Shisui was mortally wounded by Danzo and entrusted Itachi with his remaining eye to achieve peace.</p>

                        <h3>Bond of Itachi & Sasuke</h3>
                        <p>They were siblings so in a way, that’s a bond you can’t break easily. Furthermore, Itachi raised him. Their parents were busy - in the series we can actually see Itachi taking care of him. Sasuke was always happy to spend time with Itachi even though the latter is a few years older with duties of his own.

                            So imagined how painful it was for Sasuke to see his whole clan dead in the hands of someone he worships and loved. Itachi was never shown to be mean to him - perhaps secretive and deceitful but never shown to hurt him directly. Itachi to Sasuke’s eyes was perfect. The perfect son, the perfect brother, the perfect shinobi.
                            
                            Sasuke also mourned Itachi’s death. He was ready to annihilate the village elders for what they did to his brother. Imagine all his life, Sasuke harbored hatred for Itachi - but in finding out how his brother was manipulated and used; he immediately went all out - so it’s safe to say that amidst what Itachi may have done to his clan, there was the bond (love) that remained that fueled Sasuke’s thirst for blood for his brother.</p>
